- ⚡ Fun fact: *Bananas are berries, but strawberries are not! According to botanical definitions, bananas qualify as berries because they develop from a single flower with one ovary. On the other hand, strawberries are considered "aggregate fruits" because they form from a flower with multiple ovaries.🍌🍓*
